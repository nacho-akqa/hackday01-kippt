# HackDay #01 (Node Email Server)
=============================================

### Introduction

We currently share many resources within the Web Development team, either through Email or other means.
There are potentially better ways to do this, such as making use of social bookmarking services like Kippt, Delicious or Pocket.
During the first AKQA Hack Day we'd like to attempt to create an internal link-sharing service leveraging the Kippt API. The idea is to contribute to the AKQA Web Development list internally, then build a service that can aggregate and mail the links out on a weekly basis.


There are future plans to build a standalone page to showcase these links, or pull them in to the AKQA Dev Blog.
